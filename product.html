                can be used to detect different gases containing the MQ-9 gas sensor is SnO2, which has lower
                conductivity in clean air. It makes detection by cycling high and low temperature and detects CO when
                low temperature (heated by 1.5V). The sensor’s conductivity is higher along with the gas concentration
                rising. When temperature rises (heated by 5.0V), it detects Methane, Propane, combustible gas, etc and
                cleans the other gases as it adsorbed under low temperature. MQ-9 usually applied in domestic gas
                leakage detector, industrial gas detector, portable gas detector, etc.</p>

            <ol>
                <li><b>Safety Monitoring and Alerts:</b> Smart helmets are equipped with various sensors that can
                    monitor environmental conditions such as air quality, temperature, humidity, and presence of toxic
                    gases. They can detect hazardous conditions in real-time and alert miners to potential dangers,
                    allowing them to take preventive measures and evacuate if necessary.</li>
                <li><b>Health Monitoring:</b> Smart helmets can monitor vital signs of miners such as heart rate, body
                    temperature, and fatigue levels. This data can help identify signs of exhaustion or health issues
                    early on, allowing for timely intervention and preventing accidents or health emergencies.</li>
                <li><b>Location Tracking:</b> Using GPS and RFID technology, smart helmets can track the location of
                    miners within the mine, enabling supervisors to monitor their movements and ensure they are in
                    safe areas. In the event of an emergency, location tracking can facilitate rescue operations and
                    evacuation procedures.</li>
                <li><b>Communication and Collaboration:</b> Smart helmets are equipped with built-in communication
                    systems such as two-way radios, voice commands, and hands-free calling features. This enables
                    seamless communication among miners, supervisors, and other personnel, facilitating collaboration
                    and coordination during mining operations.</li>
                <li><b>Data Collection and Analysis:</b> Smart helmets can collect data on various aspects of mining
                    operations, including production rates, equipment status, and environmental conditions. This data
                    can be analyzed to identify trends, optimize workflows, and make informed decisions to improve
                    efficiency and productivity.</li>
                <li><b>Remote Assistance and Training:</b> Smart helmets can provide remote assistance and training to
                    miners by offering access to instructional videos, manuals, and troubleshooting guides. This
                    enables miners to acquire new skills, receive guidance on equipment operation, and troubleshoot
                    issues without the need for on-site supervision.</li>
